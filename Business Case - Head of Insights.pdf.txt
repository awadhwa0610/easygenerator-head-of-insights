Business Case Interview: Head of Insights 
Purpose of the Case 
This business case is designed to assess your ability to explore product usage data, 
extract actionable insights, and develop a thoughtful data and research strategy for a 
product initiative. It reflects the type of work you would engage in at Easygenerator, 
collaborating cross-functionally, influencing product decisions through data, and 
helping shape how we measure success. 
Case Structure 
The case consists of two parts: 
Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Insights 
You will receive a sample dataset containing user-level and event-level product data. 
Your task is to explore the data and deliver a concise, insight-driven report. 
Your Objective 
Generate meaningful insights from the data that help answer product and business 
questions. You can structure your report as a slide deck, document, or notebook. 
Whatever you prefer, as long as it is clear and actionable. While you can take the case 
in whichever direction you want, here are some broad pointers:  
• What drives engagement and retention 
• How users experience the product 
• Where the biggest opportunities for improvements are 
What We’re Looking For 
• Clarity of thought and prioritization 
• Ability to uncover actionable insights, not just summarize the data 
• Strong communication of findings (visuals, summaries, recommendations) 
• Curiosity and product sense
